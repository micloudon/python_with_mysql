In this project we see how to use python in conjunction with mysql.

This is basically a skeleton which performs mysql commands using Python files.

It could make working with databases on a large scale much more efficient.

I'll explain what each file does with a comment.

For demonstation I play with 2 databases, one named 'sample' the other named 'mickeydb'.

mysql-connector connector must be installed with pip:

pip install mysql-connector

or you can initialize a virtual environment and install the package at the same time;
which I prefer:

pipenv install mysql-connector
